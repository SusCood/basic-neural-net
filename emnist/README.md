# EMNIST data
Download the [EMNIST dataset](https://www.nist.gov/itl/products-and-services/emnist-dataset) ([direct download link](http://www.itl.nist.gov/iaui/vip/cs_links/EMNIST/gzip.zip)), and extract twice to get the binary data files (no file extension). Place 4 files in their respective folders.

Give the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.05373v1.pdf) a read too, sometime!
